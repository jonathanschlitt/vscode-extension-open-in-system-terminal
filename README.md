# Open in System Terminal

This extension enables opening files or folders in the default external system terminal instead of using the integrated VSCode terminal. It mirrors the functionality of VSCode's `Open in Integrated Terminal` but utilizes the system's default terminal application. To change the default external terminal app, access VSCode Settings by pressing `Cmd+,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux), navigate to `Features > Terminal`, and modify the `Terminal > External` setting based on your operating system.

## Features

This extension allows you to:

- Open any file or folder location in your system's default terminal with a simple right-click command.
- You can switch between different external terminals through your VSCode settings.

## Requirements

No specific requirements needed for this extension. It uses existing configurations within VSCode for external terminals.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings to allow finer control and customization:

- `open-in-system-terminal.showNotification`: Toggle to show/hide a notification when the terminal is opened.

## Known Issues

No known issues at this time. If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.

## Release Notes
